          <p>The parametric "wave wall" is defined by a series of points, which are moved along the z-axis based on their distance from a defined curve. The user can determine the number of fins and the resolution of the wave's curve with sliders. In this case, the height of the wave wall is shorter the closer it is to the set curve.</p>
