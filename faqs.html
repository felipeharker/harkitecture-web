            <h3>What Is a Grasshopper Definition?</h3>

            <p>A Grasshopper definition is a collection of interconnected components that define a specific
                parametric process or design in Rhino. It consists of visual programming elements such as inputs
                (parameters), logic (components), and outputs (results), and allows users to create complex forms,
                structures, or behaviors by manipulating geometry and data. A Grasshopper definition can be thought
                of as a digital workflow that automatically updates in real-time as input values change.

            <h3>What is <i><u>Internalized Data</u></i> in Grasshopper?</h3>
            <p>Internalizing the data of a Grasshopper component allows the component to act independently of its
                Rhino counterpart. For example, if you set a curve or geometry in Grasshopper from Rhino and decide
                to move the curve later, the component data will reflect that move. However, once data is
                internalized, it will not. Users can also delete Rhino elements which are attached to Grasshopper
                components once they have internalized the data within the component.<br>To internalize the data
                contained within any Grasshopper component, <b>right click the component and select <i>"internalize
                data"</i></b>.

            <h3>What Does it Mean to <i><u>Bake</u></i> a Component in Grasshopper?</h3>
            <p>In Grasshopper, any component which contains modeled information (which excludes numeric values from
                sliders, domains, etc) can be baked into it's Rhino counterpart file. When doing so, users can
                select the layer on which the geometry will go, its location, etc.<br>The benefits of baking a
                Grasshopper component include being able to further manipulate it in Rhino, attach materials, and
                render.<br>To bake a geometry from Grasshopper into Rhino, <b>right click the component and select
                "bake".</b>

            <h3>What Is a Cluster Within Grasshopper?</h3>
            <p>A Cluster in Grasshopper is a way to group a set of components together into a single, reusable unit.
                This allows you to simplify your definition, improve organization, and create modular systems. Once
                components are inside a Cluster, they can be treated as a single component with its own inputs and
                outputs. Clusters are useful for creating custom sub-routines that you can use across different
                definitions without having to rebuild the logic each time.

            <h3>What Is a Grasshopper Parameter? What Do They Do?</h3>
            <p>Parameters in Grasshopper are the values that define the input or output of a component. They can be
                numbers, geometry, or other types of data, and they are crucial for manipulating and controlling the
                flow of information through your definition. The parameters control how a component behaves and
                interacts with other components. By changing the values of parameters, you can influence the
                resulting geometry, data, or behavior of the entire definition. Parameters can be dynamic, allowing
                the design to adapt to changes.

            <h3>What Kinds of Parameters Can Be Used as Input?</h3>
            <p>There are many types of parameters that can be used as inputs in Grasshopper. Some common ones
                include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Number sliders:</strong> Used for numerical input, such as defining dimensions, angles,
                    or other scalar values.</li>
                <li><strong>Geometry:</strong> Points, curves, surfaces, and meshes that represent spatial objects
                    in Rhino.</li>
                <li><strong>Vectors:</strong> 2D or 3D directional data, often used for transformations and forces.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Booleans:</strong> Input values that are either "True" or "False" (used to control
                    conditional behavior).</li>
                <li><strong>Strings:</strong> Text data used for labels, file paths, or other non-numeric input.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Lists:</strong> Arrays or sequences of data that can represent multiple items at once,
                    such as a series of points or numbers.</li>
                <li><strong>Colours:</strong> Input values for color properties (usually RGB values).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each type of parameter influences the behavior and output of the components it is connected to.</p>

            <h3>What Kinds of Parameters Will Be Output?</h3>
            <p>Similar to input parameters, output parameters in Grasshopper can represent various data types. Some
                common output parameters include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Geometry:</strong> The resulting shapes or forms generated by the definition, such as
                    points, curves, surfaces, or meshes.</li>
                <li><strong>Vectors:</strong> Output vectors that represent movement, direction, or forces in the
                    model.</li>
                <li><strong>Numbers:</strong> Calculated numerical values, such as measurements, angles, or any
                    other type of scalar output.</li>
                <li><strong>Lists:</strong> Collections of items that are processed or transformed, often used to
                    represent arrays of values or geometry.</li>
                <li><strong>Booleans:</strong> Output that indicates a true or false condition based on logic or
                    computations.</li>
                <li><strong>Text (Strings):</strong> Output of string values, such as names, labels, or file paths.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Output parameters are how the result of the Grasshopper definition is transferred back to Rhino or
                used for further operations.</p>

            <h3>How Do I Move a Grasshopper Definition into Rhino?</h3>
            <p>To move a Grasshopper definition into Rhino, you can "bake" the geometry created in Grasshopper into
                Rhino's modeling environment. Baking allows you to convert the parametric objects from Grasshopper
                into actual Rhino objects that can be edited, rendered, or used for further modeling. Here's how to
                do it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Select the output geometry in your Grasshopper definition.</li>
                <li>Right-click on the component that generates the geometry.</li>
                <li>Choose "Bake" from the context menu.</li>
                <li>Specify which layer or location you want the geometry to be placed in within Rhino.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once baked, the geometry will no longer be parametric and will become a standard Rhino object.
                However, the Grasshopper definition will still control the parametric relationships as long as the
                definition is active.</p>
