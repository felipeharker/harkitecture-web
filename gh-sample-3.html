          <p>To create this definition, a triangular grid is created by establishing a cell dimension and the x- and y-axis extents of the grid. from there, points are extracted from the vertices of the grid. Those points, and their edges, are the foundational elements of the triangular pattern. A point along any grid cell's edge can be evaluated and moved based on user-defined conditions. These moves result in the pattern created here.</p>
