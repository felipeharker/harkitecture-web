                        Collingsworth Marketplace is a proposed commercial development in Northside, Houston,
                        Texas. The project seeks to create a walkable, family-oriented multi-use area in a historic
                        and culturally rich community. Collingsworth Marketplace combines commercial spaces such as
                        offices, retail, and dining with natural outdoor areas, parks, and community spaces. The end
                        goal of the project is to bring about economic prosperity with a focus on eco-friendly design,
                        passive cooling and ventilation strategies, hydrological solutions for flooding and rainwater,
                        and strategic adaptive reuse.

                        Usable structures located on the existing site for Collingsworth Marketplace will be adapted into their proposed programs.

                    <p>
                        The indoor-outdoor marketplace is designed from an existing warehouse structure which spans two blocks on the site. Updates to the structure will focus on ecology and human comfort year-round by using passive cooling and ventillation strategies as well as non-energy intensive electrical and mechanical strategies.
