            <p>
                These articles are a portion of the research conducted by the Alexandria team. The papers are compiled
                and written using an LLM, and edited by hand. The purpose of these papers is to showcase the
                relationship between parametric design work and artificial intelligence. As AI models become more
                sophisticated, they will be able to assist with more and more complex parametric and computational
                design workflows. This page is a work in progress.
